### Hi there 👋

I'm Jake Payne, and I'm a software engineer. Sound a bit like a robot? Yea I agree, let's add some creativity to this profile!

## 🏫 Background

I attended a small high school in central Illinois growing up, where I played 🏀 and ⛳. I even managed to finish top 50 at state my senior year! I've always been a pretty big 🖥️ gamer, playing such titles as League of Legends and Pokemon! I also love collectible card games, like Magic: the Gathering and Yu-gi-oh! I spent the remaining free time I had just surfing the internet to learn this, that, and anything else my mind could digest at the time!

Afterward, I ventured onward to new grounds, expanding my horizons by going on my own to <img align="center" width="3%" src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26901356/150296303-053a0b3e-1ac9-4ce4-86df-26d167eda6ad.png />  
While there, I pursued a degree in Medical Lab Sciences, which had me take some scary but rewarding courses such as:
<ul>
  <li> Clinical Hematology </li>
  <li> Clinical Chemisty </li>
  <li> Organic Chemistry </li>
  <li> you get the rest... </li>
</ul>
As well as some more off-topic courses such as:
<ul>
  <li> Developmental Psychology </li>
  <li> Education in American Culture</li>
  <li> Comparative Politics</li>
</ul>  

I find a majority of the scientific field fascinating, and do my best to keep up on all the daily news surrounding any aspect of it!

## 👨‍🔬 Onto Work!

My first position was technically in college as a Resident Advisor, but skipping past that to some of the more interesting positions (even though I do have a funny story or two)

### 🧪 Clinical Lab Sciences!

As a clinical lab scientist, your duty is to perform daily maintenance tasks on the instrumentation, as well as run quality control. You also perform patient specimen testing and report these results to nurses and doctors in charge of care for that patient. Man it sounds quite boring when I put it like that.Let's try this...  

- I worked on and fixed (sometimes!) some very large and expensive machinery, and seeing how it all worked together made me feel like a novice engineer 🔧! 
- I helped deliver blood to people in dire need to save their life! On the less exciting side, I also got to see various kinds of bodily cells under microscopes. Here's one: <img align="center" width="5%" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/920440490548146189/933634974408671262/IMG_20191101_050710_01.jpg" />

I performed this position at two different hospitals, moving across the country in between jobs ✈️ ---- 🏜️ from Illinois to Arizona!  
After a while, I realized I much more preferred figuring out and working on the computer aspect of each machine, and realized the software they currently used in the laboratory was pretty oudated 🤔. That led me to Software Engineering / Programming!

## ⌨️ Software Engingeering 

I love doing this. Figuring out the bugs and problems before and after they arise, creating a way to provide a function or service from complete scratch, even those late, long nights of grinding away with music on in the background as you ponder what to name this temporary variable that you only ever access once, but you want to preserve the thought process in the name so others understand what you were doing, I love it all! (Listen, I know that was a run on, but I just liked the way it sounded as I read it to myself.)

Here's to an everlasting career 💼 as a software engineer!
